    <h2>Costa del Sol – Malaga – Andalusia – Spain</h2>
    <p>Casa Las Jaras and its private pool area are set in an enviable location, where you can enjoy sweeping mountain scenery and the warmth of the Andalusian sun, softened by fresh mountain breezes. This unique setting makes the villa a wonderful place for a holiday at any time of year.</p>
    <p>Our villa is pet-friendly, with the surrounding countryside offering endless open spaces and trails where dogs can roam freely — the perfect escape for you and your four-legged companions.</p>
    <p>The secluded position also makes it ideal for couples seeking naturist-friendly accommodation. Unlike hotels or shared resorts, here you will have complete privacy — the pool, sunbeds and outdoor areas are for your exclusive use, with no neighbors overlooking. Relax and enjoy your holiday exactly as you wish.</p>
    <p>And while Casa Las Jaras feels wonderfully remote, it remains easily accessible by standard vehicles, as the entire track is concreted — no 4x4 required.</p>
    <p>Discover the real Spain: unspoilt countryside, breathtaking mountain views, and glorious weather await you.</p>

              <p>'A haven of tranquility. Some holidays are enjoyable, but by the time they are over we are ready to return home. That was not the case after our stay at Casa Las Jaras. We had such a warm welcome and a relaxing stay that it was a real wrench to leave. The property is secluded and peaceful. Although there is plenty to do and see in the local area, on warm days we preferred to simply laze by the pool whilst butterflies (of which there are many) danced through the garden. If you enjoy bird watching, then you don’t need to move from the garden to see many different species. In fact, many would obligingly flit past the terrace where we sat for our meals, with a spectacular view of the valley. We were sorry to leave, but we hope to be back soon. Many thanks for a peaceful and rejuvenating break.'</p>

              <p>'The perfect hideaway. This modest looking house may lack the wow factor in photos, but it made a superb holiday home. Very comfortable and spotlessly clean, glorious views across the empty valley, but the trump card is the complete seclusion of the attractive pool area &amp; terraces.'</p>

              <p>'We had a wonderful holiday. We could have just lazed in the garden all day listening to the birdsong and enjoying the lovely views over the hills. This is a place for people who enjoy nature and peaceful surroundings, it is good walking country in scenic countryside and so nice to return home to.'</p>

              <p>'I would highly recommend Las Jaras for families or couples looking to explore this picturesque, off the beaten track, corner of rural Andalucia. The villa and its pool are hard to leave behind. It is definitely worth exploring this part of Andalucia, with highlights including the historic city of Malaga, Ronda and Antequera. We will definitely be returning.'</p>

              <p>'Thank you so much for our lovely week at your villa. The villa was exactly as described, nothing was hidden and lots of lovely extras were provided. It was so refreshing to really feel as though every care had been taken to make sure that we had the nicest time. I could go on forever about how wonderful it was but sometimes I think that more can be said by saying less. It was perfect.'</p>

              <p>'This was our first visit to Spain, and on recommendation from friends we booked this lovely villa. We were not disappointed! Had many lovely days by the pool, or at local beaches, and on cooler days we were able to take trips. Lots to do, but the villa was hard to leave and had all we needed for a very relaxing holiday. Thanks for all the useful information as well.'</p>
